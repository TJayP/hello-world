# hello-world

Hey GitNub!

My name is Tyler, and I am 17 years old. Currently a senior in High School looking to pursue Computer Science and Software Development in College! I'm still a little new to programming, but it's all about practice, and becoming the best I can be with more and more practice, and getting the help from people on open-source sites like this!
