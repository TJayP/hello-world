# hello-world

Hey GitNub!

My name is Tyler, and I am 21 years old. Currently in college looking to pursue Software Engineering! Everything in here was created by me using Java or other type of languages. Just depends on what I'm feeling at the time. If you have any questions or anything, please feel free to PM me!
